# About the project

### the "big idea" or "what is it for":

to put it simple, I created this project so beginner programmers
can practice working in a team, and practice their programming skills.


*why a game? game programming is complex and challenging(also not easy), it requires both
finess and creativity, one day you're doing AI on another your doing database
design, GUI, graphics, etc, etc.
you can get the most "fabulous"/terrible errors and bugs.
in short its good "real world" practice.


*why text-based? in short, faster development, no graphics, not much of a GUI.
just adding features. nothing too complex to learn for beginners.
the base source for this game was coded by me in less than a few days (including
the base framework/tools etc, I worked on it on and off in my free time).
i made it to be easy to pick up and start working on it.


*who shod join? mainly beginner programmers that want to practice programming
and learn how to work in a team.
we will also need writers for story/ingame descriptions text.
game designers may also join and test their metal.
while I do all the marketing, I wouldn't mind help, if you want to learn
proper indie game marketing I can show you stuff most people don't do 
(which leads their game to flop).

*what shod you know? basic programming, the big idea is making this simple
and easy to work with/get into.
if you want todo writing/, marketing you can just join ill show you the rest.

*does it have documentation: [yes](https://github.com/yoel123/java-text-based-space-station-manger-sim/wiki) its wip.

*How to join? hers a contact form:
